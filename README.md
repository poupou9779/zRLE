zRLE
====

zRLE is an implementation of the Run-Length Encoding.4 functions : encode a string, decode a string, encode a file, decode a file.

Warning :
* encode_RLE sin't bugged anymore
* decode_RLE crashes l.108 when I run the program but when I try to debug with gdb, nothing goes wrong. STILL GOTTA BE CHECKED !
* file functions aren't checked, TODO in August
